     <h3> Topoly </h3>
<p>Topoly is a Python 3 package for the topological analysis of (bio)polymers.<br>
    It works on Mac OS X and Linux.<br>
Before installation make sure you have a recent version of pip by typing in terminal:<br>
<code>pip3 install --upgrade pip</code><br>
Then install by typing:<br>
<code>pip3 install topoly</code><br>

     <h3> Knot_Pull </h3>
<p>Knot_Pull is Python 3 package for simplifying a 3D structure while preserving its topology.<br>
Before installation make sure you have a recent version of pip by typing in terminal:<br>
<code>pip3 install --upgrade pip</code><br>
Then install by typing:<br>
<code>pip3 install knot_pull</code><br>

     <h3> Genus for biomolecules </h3>
<p>Genus for biomolecules is a database that collects information about
topological structure and complexity of proteins and RNA chains, which
is captured by the genus of a given chain and its subchains. For each
biomolecule this information is shown in the form of a genus trace
plot, as well as a genus matrix diagram. Such information is assembled
for all protein and RNA structures deposited in the PDB.</p>
